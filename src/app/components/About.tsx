        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Frontend Developer who enjoys creating modern and responsive
          websites. My expertise lies in the areas of HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          TypeScript coding, React, and Next.js. My aim is to produce interfaces
          that are clean, accessible, and user-friendly. I find pleasure in
          transforming UI designs into web-based experiences. I prefer Tailwind
          CSS to achieve quick and refined results.? I am constantly refining my
          frontend skills. I am primarily focused on delivering performance,
          responsiveness, and clarity. Why? Each line of code I write is
          dedicated to solving an actual problem.

        <h2>What I do when not coding? </h2>
        <p>
          When not coding, I am learning and creating. I am fond of exploring
          the world of AI and staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends.
          Occasionally, I create project concepts or plan for future
          undertakings. Reading about the impact of technology on our future is
          something I really enjoy. Frequently, I will be watching developer
          videos or browsing design inspiration reels. I find pleasure in
          calming myself through enjoyable walks. Spending time with loved ones
          keeps me grounded and motivated. I frequently re-evaluate my progress
          and set new learning objectives.
