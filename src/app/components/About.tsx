          As a passionate and self-reliant Frontend Developer with expertise in{" "}
          <strong>
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript , TypeScript, React.js, Next.js.
          </strong>
          My passion is creating visually appealing and user-friendly web
          interfaces that are also clean and responsive. I am constantly
          learning and improving, at the moment learning Python more deeply in a
          world filled with AI agents and newer web technologies.? My passion
          lies in creating eye-catching portfolios, resolving technical problems
          through code, and exploring new tools like Tailwind CSS. Creating
          successful digital products, working with talented teams and making an
          impact on the tech community is what I aim to achieve. &ldquo;. When
          not coding, I am likely spending time online learning about new
          technologies and sharing my knowledge with others or brainstorming
          ideas for my next project. Why is that?
